                <p>Born on January 1, 1975, in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, Eiichiro Oda is one of the most successful manga artists in history. From an early age, he was inspired by works like <b>Dragon Ball</b> and <b>Vikings</b>, which later shaped the adventurous world of <b>One Piece</b>.</p>
                    <p>At just 17 years old, Oda entered the manga industry as an assistant artist for several popular manga, including <b>Rurouni Kenshin</b>. His talent quickly gained recognition, and he started developing <b>Romance Dawn</b>, the prototype of what would later become <b>One Piece</b>.</p>
                    <p>In 1997, <b>One Piece</b> began serialization in <b>Weekly Shōnen Jump</b>. The manga quickly rose to fame due to its deep storytelling, unique characters, and masterful world-building.
